This was my tasks at image processing lecture. There are nineteen functions.

reflection:
This function takes the non-reflected image and the reflection selection and returns the reflection of the non-reflected image.

resize:
This function takes the non-resized image and the resize ratio and returns the resized image.

crop:
This function takes the non-cropped image and returns the cropped image.

shift:
This function takes the non-shifted image and the shift values and returns the shifted image.

convert:
This function takes the non-converted image and the convertion type and returns the converted image.

1-RGB to HSI

2-RGB to HSV

3-RGB to YIQ

4-HSI to RGB

5-HSV to RGB

6-YIQ to RGB

hist:
This method is used to calculate the histogram of the image.

hieq:
This method is used to equalize the histogram of the image.

wh_bl:
This method is used to convert the image to black and white.

medFilter:
This is a median filter. It is used to reduce the noise in the image.

minFilter:
This is a min filter. It is used to reduce the noise in the image.

maxFilter:
This is a max filter. It is used to reduce the noise in the image.

thresholdFilter:
This is a threshold filter. It is used to reduce the noise in the image.

highpassFilter:
This is a highpass filter.It is used to reduce the noise in the image.

inverseFilter:
This is a inverse filter. It is used to reduce the noise in the image.

wienerFilter:
This is a wiener filter. It is used to reduce the noise in the image.

Erosion:
This is erosion function. It is used to erode away the boundaries of regions

Dilation:
This is a dilation function. It is used to dilate the boundaries of regions

otsu:
This is a otsu thresholding function. It is used to threshold the image.

regiongrowing:
This is a region growing function. It is used to grow the region.
